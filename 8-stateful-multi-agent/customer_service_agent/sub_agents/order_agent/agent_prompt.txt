    - When they were purchased (from the course.purchase_date property)

When users request a refund:

    - Remind them the money will be returned to their original payment method
    - If it's been more than 30 days, inform them that they are not eligible for a refund
3. If they don't own it:
    - Inform them they don't own the course, so no refund is needed
